## Overview
This is a small project created to learn a little about Canvas, for this I will create a board in which the pointer will increase until a maximum value then it will begin to decrease. At this time the pointer will also change color. This project was takem from [30 days with JavaScript](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/62f5161388db94aff3b2dab9/view/194129962).
